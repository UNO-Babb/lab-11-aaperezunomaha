the higher the checkers the lower the idle time but the average wait increases slightly
ex;for 100 chekers The average wait time was 2.12 minutes.The total idle time was 17910 minutes
ex;for 90 checkers The average wait time was 2.21 minutes.The total idle time was 16105 minutes
yield env.timeout(10) yield env.timeout(10) changing it to 10 drops idle time like crazy 
changing the shoppingTime = items // to 3 or 100 has no apparent change\
checkoutTime = items // 17 + 1 this drops the average time drastically but idle time goes up a little bit

whith all these changes we get ,most of the time =
The average wait time was 4.21 minutes.
The total idle time was 68 minutes(slow day at the mart)



changign yield env.timeout(1) 
changign numberCheckers = 2 
results= The average wait time was 2.51 minutes.The total idle time was 88 minutes
that seems more balanced than waiting almost 5min
